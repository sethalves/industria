;; Mark Adler's Adler-32 checksum (used by zlib). Provides the same
;; procedures as (weinholt crypto crc), but Adler-32 is not a CRC.

;; (adler-32 bytevector)
;;     returns the final Adler-32 checksum of the entire bytevector
;; (adler-32-init)
;;     returns an initial Adler-32 state
;; (adler-32-update state bv)
;; (adler-32-update state bv start)
;; (adler-32-update state bv start end)
;;     returns a new state which includes the checksum on the given bytes
;; (adler-32-finish state)
;;     returns the final checksum
;; (adler-32-width)
;;     returns the bit-width of the checksum, i.e. 32
;; (adler-32-self-test)
;;     returns 'sucess, 'failure, or 'no-self-test
